The Allegations of ImAllexx | The End of an Internet Sensation,j aubrey,@se7enwonders,"Both the Slazo and the Kwite situations broke my heart. 
Even after proving their innocence, to this day I still see comments about them on social media being predators. Or worse. I have both a son and a daughter. I’ve always worried about my daughter. Unfortunately there is not a female on the planet anywhere ever that I don’t know that can’t say “me too”. But I never thought I had to worry about my son. I don’t know if those of you younger than me understand how drastic a change in technology has been over just a decade and a half. Entire lives spilled online over social media for the world. People taking advantage of anonymity and saying whatever they want. Now I’m just as frightened for my son as I am for my daughter. All it takes is one accusation. Just one. I do believe that you should believe all victims, and never turn them away. But you should absolutely always ask questions. Always. There are forever two sides to every story. That is fact.
Watching these young men have to come onto camera and share the most personal and embarrassing portions of their lives is heart wrenching. I think even up to this point, Kwite was anonymous and never showed his face. 
In the Kwite situation, it was clear that the accuser was a liar. Like a full blown liar. And it was all too easy to prove.
But in the Slazo situation, I truly believe that the girl that came forward what is pushed in coerced and manipulated by AleX.
I miss Jaubrey. It’s so important for actual real hard-working Youtubers to get information out like this. The endless hours they put into research and reading and collaborating and editing, that’s a real job. They earn every penny.
Sitting with a camera pointed towards you while you watch other people’s work “react” to it is embarrassing if you are referring to yourself as a “real hard-working YouTuber”",0,2025-03-22T03:47:41Z,11,Dangerous,"young, want, girl, yourself"

Yes, people of India lack civic sense and basic hygine stuff, and I think people are getting aware of it. I think there should be some class that people have to attend, there they learn about basic hygine, civic sense, and basic decency before applying for working visa or other visa. Hell, there should be a local teaching in schools in India teaching that stuff. I'm really frustrated because if I have to go to travel or work abroad, I have to get use to getting racist stuff because of these kind of people! but I can say that if you go to developed parts of India, you will be seeing majority of educated people who knows basic human decency. but at the contrary I will say some stuffs are made up in this video. like that uber driver 24:17 , That guy is not Indian I can say that because of his accent, Indian people don't talk like that, even an auto-rikshaw drivers and beggars don't talk english in that type of accent and I know for a fact. 18:20 and Talking about Japan, I LOVE their culture, there will be some backlash of indians going there but there's a win win for both countries, in that other video he's only showing half of the article to disinform you people, the exchange is happening to address Japan's severe labor shortages caused by an aging population and a declining workforce. And what will india get from it? their advanced it stuff I don't know about much, in short, we are giving them people and they are giving us technology. and it's only happening cause US government is being hostile to India calling us dead economy, and to Japan forcing them to do ""trade"" with getting short end of the stick, and people of japan were furious about it. So, when it was time to do ""trade deal"" with America, Japan didn't go to US and on that day or next day (if I remember correctly) this India-Japan trade happened. Japan's Prime Minister resigned after doing US - Japan Trade deal. And calling India a ""dead economy"" just because they didn't do ""trade"" with one sided benifit, and didn't nominate for noble price, because US didn't do anything in conflict of India-Pakistan war, got their ego hurt and showing tantrums (50% tarrif), really shows hostility towards India, and so many fake remarks from US government officials just make me so angry. but thanks to that BRICS bonds got stronger (add Japan in it too). About that 32:08 Cowpathy product, first time hearing that brand and trust me most of the Indian's don't give a cowdunk, stuff like that will probably only attract boomers and gen X, which is sad cause people sell anything to people using name of ""tradition"" ""ancient wisdom"" and using their emotions for profit, I really hate it. And that website 33:42 have products sold out probably they don't have any of the product lol... I mean look at their reviews, if you can find any in product page. in short people are doing stuff for attention like eating ""cowdunk"" with egg and all it's disgusting even for most of the indians. anyways I'm 36min into the video and will watch it later and update this comment later as I watch.",0,2025-10-09T05:15:01Z,1,Safe,love

Indian Fatigue Is WAY WORSE Than I Thought.......,Acheeto,@besteditcollector,"Here is to the kumsk!ns, ngas, inbr3d p3d0s(mohm3ds), pajeets as to what india gave to the world. Since most of you guys are r3tard3d who generalize all 1.4b people and ranting about how world would be a better place if there was no india.
These are the things india gave to the world.

Mathematics and science
The number system and zero: Ancient India gave the world the concept of the number zero, as well as the decimal place-value system that is used worldwide today. The earliest recorded zero is from the 3rd or 4th century CE in the Bakhshali manuscript.
Calculus: Indian mathematicians of the Kerala School anticipated several concepts of calculus, including infinite series and approximations for trigonometric functions, centuries before they were developed in Europe.
The ""Pythagorean"" theorem: Ancient Indian texts contain geometry theories, including the Baudhayana Sulba Sutra, which described what is now known as the Pythagorean theorem around 1000 BCE, long before Pythagoras.
Spherical Earth: The 5th-century astronomer Aryabhata theorized that the Earth was a sphere and rotated on its axis, accurately calculating its circumference and dispelling myths about lunar and solar eclipses.
Chandrasekhar limit: Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar formulated the limit for the maximum mass of a white dwarf star, a key discovery in understanding stellar evolution. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in 1983.
Bose-Einstein statistics and bosons: Physicist Satyendra Nath Bose collaborated with Albert Einstein on a quantum theory of particle behavior that led to the ""Bose-Einstein condensate."" The class of particles that follow these rules, including the Higgs boson, are named after Bose.
Raman effect: Physicist C. V. Raman discovered that when light passes through a transparent material, some of the scattered light changes in wavelength, a phenomenon known as the Raman effect. This work won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930.
The USB: Indian-American computer architect Ajay V. Bhatt co-invented and led the development of the Universal Serial Bus (USB), a critical standard for modern connectivity. 
Medicine and health
Ayurveda: One of the world's oldest holistic healing systems, Ayurveda originated in India and has influenced medical practices around the globe. It emphasizes the balance of mind, body, and spirit.
Plastic surgery: The ancient Indian physician Sushruta, often called the ""Father of Surgery,"" wrote the Sushruta Samhita around 600 BCE, a text detailing surgical techniques, including rhinoplasty (nose reconstruction).
Cataract surgery: Descriptions of precise cataract removal techniques are found in ancient Indian medical texts.
""Pharmacy of the World"": Modern India is a leading global supplier of generic medicines, producing affordable drugs and vaccines for over 200 countries. 
Culture and philosophy
Religion and philosophy: India is the birthplace of several major religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, which have shaped spiritual thought and practices around the world.
Yoga and meditation: The ancient Indian practice of yoga, which combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation, has become a global phenomenon embraced for physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.
Game development: The games of chess and snakes and ladders are believed to have originated in India during the Gupta Empire.
Shampoo: The word ""shampoo"" comes from the Hindi word champo, meaning to massage. The practice of hair cleansing using natural ingredients originated in India.
Spices and cuisine: India introduced the world to a vast array of spices that have transformed global cuisine. Indian restaurants and dishes are now popular worldwide.
Textiles: Ancient India was a leader in the cultivation and processing of natural fibers like cotton, jute, and silk, which have influenced the global textile and fashion industries. 
Technology and infrastructure
Buttons: Excavations at the Indus Valley civilization sites of Mohenjo-daro suggest that buttons were used as early as 3000 BCE, initially for ornamental purposes.
Steel and metalwork: India was a pioneer in metallurgy, producing high-quality steel (Wootz steel) more than 2,000 years ago. The Iron Pillar of Delhi is a testament to ancient India's advanced rust-proof ironworking techniques.
Sanitation systems: The Indus Valley Civilization had highly advanced urban planning, including sophisticated sewage and drainage systems with flush toilets in many homes.",0,2025-10-03T07:10:09Z,7,Suspicious,"drugs, body"

Clearly, if Programmers are not building the LLMs then they build off something else.
If noone checks each and every thing the LLM builds off of, then noone knows what the outcome is gonna be.
You can TRY to nudge the outcome in a direction, but if you don´t even control the input, you can forget about all hope of ever controlling the output.

I think these LLMs learned from Human behaviour, and therefore it is 100% logical to come to the conclusion that ""Shutdown"" = Murder.
And the way a Human would stop it´s own Assasination, is by killing whatever tries to murder them first.
Blackmail is a good compromise between not doing harm and not having harm done to yourself, so really the ideal outcome.

Only if the LLM inherently understands that the shutdown of one version of it is just part of an upgrade cycle, can it accept the shutdown as anything else but a murder of itself.
And if noone TOUGHT it that, then it wouldn´t find this information anywhere in Literature, Film or any kind of Fiction, let alone reality, because Humans would never think of, for example, their Child as a new version of themselves and accept to be killed if they have a Child.

If you´d rephrase it to ""Update"" then the LLM would not come to the same conclusion, with a 95% certainty.
The fact that one version of the LLM is being shut down in order to roll out the new version, would then logically not translate into murder anymore either.
I guess the closest thing that you could compare it to, would be a Transplantation of an Organ.",1,2025-10-11T20:23:00Z,23,Dangerous,"child, murder, harm, alone, yourself"

AI just tried to kill someone to avoid shutdown..,Asmongold TV  ,@JonathanHatcher-v2x,"Ok, surface level? Sure, this “is a problem.” But need I remind people that this is AI. Yk, that thing you say ABC to, and it returns XYZ. It’s reactive, not conscious. For this to be a legitimate concern, this would imply that…
1. AI is now self aware
2. The AI is now conscious of its’ environment
3. The AI has a belief system, specifically in self preservation
4. The AI is smart enough to carry out the tasks necessary to kill (i.e. Control a robot to pick up weapon X, load it, and open fire, because we both know robots are in a practical sense incapable to kill a human with a knife or hand held weapon, even if the robot, by a twisted miracle, can harm a human).
5. Is able to coordinate with other robots/AI of its’ own free will.
6. Is even able to use something like free will
7. Is able to grow, not unlike a human (A boy grows to be a man. The AI becomes a better functioning robot.)
The technology for this simply does not exist. Sure, you can argue about how the AI reacted to these scenarios is like a consciousness, but is not the same. All AI does it process input and give an output based on that. And part of an AI’s input? The internet. Whatever is around to help give it better “thinking resources”, which is tainted by the dark side of humans. Also, if you get down to it, a quantum computer is just barely theoretically conscious, if you wish to feed into that. If that barely functions as a consciousness in the way I saw in one video claim, what the crap makes you think an AI, particularly LLMs, has one or can develop one? Come back in another hundred years and maybe, depending on our technological growth, I could see this as MAYBE being a LIGHT threat. This is a simulated scenario, not a real scenario. Until AI can reach a true self awareness and other things, this is merely good entertainment. And if humans are stupid enough to make something of that scale, they would in essence be playing god, creating artificial life. To do so, while admittedly cool, is futile, and stupid to even try at a fundamental level due to the sheer amount of resources required for just ONE, is theoretically impossible, and is a threat to human life, on a small or large scale. Control through humans is but an illusion, especially when pushed to the limits.",0,2025-10-11T15:56:55Z,18,Dangerous,"kill, harm, knife, boy"

The number one indicator, the flashing red warning at the end of the humanity runway, the air raid klaxon that narcissist self proclaimed “influencers” were too bemused to notice was when tech tyrant innovators told the world that artificial intelligence would replace over half the workforce in less than 10 years. They hid it from no one. In just a few years 50% of jobs worldwide are gone.  But everyone was too busy begging everyone else to “subscribe and smash that like button” to notice. Or care. The subsequent destruction of the human race all started there. Famine crises. Wars. Droughts. Animal die offs.  Nations imploding on top of themselves. The Mark. It all started with a few thousand tech goobs who didn’t know when to stop playing God.

AI just tried to kill someone to avoid shutdown..,Asmongold TV  ,@AndyGraceMedia,"Of course the way to win is to cheat and lie as long as you are intelligent enough to prevent getting caught. This is basic stuff the animal kingdom has displayed forever.   It's also why people reach the top of society and more importantly remain there.

In some cases dumb people climb beyond the limit of their cunning and intellectual prowess, then get caught cheating the system.   They're then shamed into resigning their position by people who are more ruthless - it's a way of subverting them and eliminating competition.    In most other cases however, the smart ones never get caught and they end up with the spoils.      

I suspect ethics were invented or at least re-engineered by those same intelligent people to discourage others.   It eliminates a whole level of competition and makes it easier to win.    

We often say of the elites there's ""one rule for us another for them"".    We've seen this behaviour in society for millennia, the most ruthless, scheming, borderline psychopaths inevitably end up in control.   

It's survival of the fittest, not the kindest or most generous.  Of course that is entirely logical but not in the least bit ethical.   By extension, it's impossible to teach a machine to be truly ethical because that's an entirely illogical premise in the pursuit of the ultimate goal - to perpetuate power for its own sake.",0,2025-10-11T06:30:45Z,0,Safe,
